# EV3EggBot
Software for the Lego Mindstorms EV3 EggBot

Easter is just around the corner and my daughter and I have recreated the EggBot (https://www.instructables.com/LEGO-EGGBOT/) with Lego Mindstorms. Since the software didn't offer many options and the patterns quickly became boring, we designed and programmed our own.
